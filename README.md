# FUDforum TWIG template

## Installation
To add this new system to your forum, 
* Create a new theme called "twig" based on the default theme. This will set up all the links needed to view the files
 through the new theme.
* Copy the "public" folder over the public folder of your forum. This will replace the public/index.php and the twig
 theme files.
* Copy the composer.json file and vendor folder into the root directory.
* Copy the FUDforum folder over the existing FUDforum folder.
* Once any changes have been made, set the twig template as default.
